# Interactive Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website created for **Lab 2 in the JavaScript course (2025)**.  
The project extends my previous portfolio with a validated contact form, a dynamic project gallery with filtering, and a theme switcher, all built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.

All functionality is handled on the client side with no backend, and development is tracked using Git with regular commits.

## Setup
Clone the repository and open `index.html` in a browser, or run it using a local development server such as VS Code Live Server.
